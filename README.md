The Titanic dataset, a classic in data science, offers a poignant lens through which to explore the factors influencing survival in the tragic 1912 sinking.  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on this dataset involves a meticulous process of cleaning and preparing the raw data, often riddled with missing values and inconsistencies.  Through descriptive statistics and compelling visualizations, analysts can uncover patterns and relationships between variables like age, gender, class, and fare, and their correlation with passenger survival.
